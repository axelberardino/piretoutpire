# PireToutPire

This project implements a simplified bittorrent clone.

# Running and playing with it

Launch a server like that:
```
cargo run -- seed
```
Then there is a CLI (using clap and colored) which can be called like that:
```
cargo run -- help
```

# Tests

Everything is tested.
```
cargo test
```

# Linting

You'll find some custom linters made with dylint. There are some very specific
rules we were enforcing in my previous company. These are examples of what can
be done.

Launch clippy:
```
cargo clippy
```

Launch personal linter:
```
# You might need to install dylint
cargo install cargo-dylint dylint-link

# Launch it!
cargo dylint --all -- --all-features --bins --examples --tests
```

## VsCode integration

It's possible to change the default cargo command in VsCode to automatically
launch clippy and dylint. Very handy to view at glance any warnings.

In settings.json, just override the default command like that:
```
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.overrideCommand": [
        "cargo",
        "dylint",
        "--all",
        "--workspace",
        "--",
        "--all-targets",
        "--message-format=json"
    ]
```
